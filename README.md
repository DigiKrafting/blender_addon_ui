# Blender Addon Pipeline

Customised 3D View toolbar (* WIP: Likely to be changed/tweaked)

# Required Blender Version

2.79 

\* May work in previous versions but untested, space_view3d.py will likely cause issues/unexpected behaviour.

# Installation

\* GitHub automatically appends the version number to the download filenames which causes blender not to load the addon, the easy fix for this is to remove the version number from the downloaded filename before installing in Blender. E.g. addon-0.5.zip to addon.zip.

Download either the tar.gz or zip from [https://github.com/Digiography/blender_addon_3dview_toolbar/releases/latest](https://github.com/Digiography/blender_addon_3dview_toolbar/releases/latest)
